# ðŸ§  On-Chain Mind Map

## ðŸ“„ Project Description

The **On-Chain Mind Map** is a simple Clarity smart contract that enables users to record and retrieve their latest thought, idea, or note â€” all directly on the blockchain. This contract stores mind map nodes on-chain in a decentralized and user-specific way, preserving ownership and data integrity.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision

Our vision is to create a **decentralized, censorship-resistant mind mapping platform** where users can freely log thoughts, ideas, and knowledge trails â€” securely and permanently. This contract is the foundational step toward a full-featured, on-chain knowledge graph where each node can be linked, traced, and shared.
